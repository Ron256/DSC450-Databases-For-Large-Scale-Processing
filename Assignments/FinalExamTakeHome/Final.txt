"""
a.Use python to download tweets from the web and save to a local text file (not into a database yet, just to a text file). 
This is as simple as it sounds, all you need is a for-loop that reads lines and writes them into a file, just don’t forget to add ‘\n’ at the end so they are, in fact, on separate lines.
NOTE: Do not call read() or readlines(). 
That command will attempt to read the entire file which is too much data. Clicking on the link in the browser would cause the same problem.
